	;UFO4P 1.0.3 Bug #20576 - GENERAL NOTES:
	;---------------------------------------
	;While monitoring this script's activities in debug mode, it was found that this event fires when the player activates the workbench (this is handled as a
	;location exit event below) and again when he leaves the menu/workshop mode (handled as a location enter event below). As a result, the reset procedure could
	;be repeated over and over again. This is not a problem at game start when settlements are small and the reset takes less than a minute. Though later on, when
	;the settlements grow, the function draws much performance and may take several minutes to complete. Sine other functions are locked out from editing work-
	;shop-related data while it's rtunning, this could lead to assignment of settlers to newly built objects taking an exceedingly long time or not working at
	;all. To prevent unnecessary resets from being carried out, this event has been modified as follows:
	;
	;(1) When the player apparently leaves from a settlement location, this location is stored in the new tracking variable UFO4P_PreviousWorkshopLocation
	;(2) When the reset function starts running, the game time is stored in the new variable UFO4P_GameTimeOfLastResetStarted
	;
	;When the player apparently enters a settlement location, the event now checks whether this is the same as the one he just left (by comparing akNewLoc
	;to UFO4P_PreviousWorkshopLocation). If this is true AND the last reset started running less than a game day before, it will not be run again. Note that
	;short leaves from the location (with 'valid' change location events), e.g. to check the environment after the turrets started shooting at something, will
	;also not result in repeated resets carried out. Travels to other locations and back only do when the workshop location unloads in the meantime or when they
	;take more than one game day.

;UFO4P 1.0.3 Bug #20775: The ResetHappiness function had to be split in two parts (the vanilla code is preserved below):

;(1) The first part starts a timer on WorkshopScript to call the DailyUpdate function. The function cannot be called directly (as in the vanilla version),
;because this thread is locked and the DailyUpdate function may call other functions on this script that are locked as well. This would result in a dead
;lock (as a result of previous edits in order to minimize threading issues - thanks to MageKing17 for spotting this). When started from a timer event on
;WorkshopScript though, the DailyUpdate function runs from a new thread, preventing a dead lock situation from occurring. Note that this part of the func-
;tion could not be included in the AddActorToWorkshop function (this is the only function on this script that calls the ResetHappiness function), because
;there is a quest script calling this function too [NB: since the vanilla ResetHappiness function was a non-public function (i.e. it allowed for modifica-
;tion of resource data values without passing a lock), this call from QF_MM01Misc was a potential issue itself. With the new ResetHappiness function, this
;risk is now eliminated as well.]
;
;The calculations carried out by the ResetHappiness function suggest that the DailyUpdate function must be run before continuing with the actual happiness
;reset. This means however that this function call has to be handled in a specific manner (unlike all other calls of DailyUpdate with bRealUpdate = false:
;they will be skipped by WorkshopScript entirely at times of high script activity). To realize this, a new bool argument was added to the DailyUpdate func-
;tion (default value is false; see WorkshopScript for further details). The timerID allows the timer event to discern calls from this script, and it will
;call the DailyUpdate function with the new bool set to true. This will have two effects: (a) the call will not be skipped, and (b) when the function fini-
;shes running, it will call the second part of the ResetHappiness function (see below) to continue with the actual reset.

function ResetHappiness(WorkshopScript workshopRef)
	wsTrace(" ResetHappiness for " + workshopRef)
	workshopRef.StartTimer(3.0, UFO4P_DailyUpdateResetHappinessTimerID)	
endFunction

;UFO4P 1.0.3 Bug #20775 (continued from above)::
;(2) The second part contains the actual code of the vanilla ResetHappiness function. This must not be carried out until the DailyUpdate has run, so this
;function will now be called from WorkshopScript when the DailyUpdate function has finished running. Since it is the only user (i.e. the call always comes
;from an external script), this new function has been made public (i.e. an edit lock was added).

;UFO4P 2.0.6: Added this function:
;A look at the workshop script framework published on GitHub (WSFW 1.0.8a - he's talking about us...) and specifically at the implementation of the UFO4P modifications to the vanilla scripts suggests
;that both UnassignActor() and UnassignActorFromObject() are considered to be valid entry points for external scripts that want to unassign a single object.
;However, both functions are private functions that do not pass a lock. External scripts must never call a private function on this script directly because this
;leads to very unpleasant threading issues that quickly make a mess of the workshop data. The misbelief may be due to the lack of a public function to handle
;the unassignment of single object, so we added this function to close this gap.
;UnassignActorFromObject() does essentially the same as UnassignObject() but also provides the possibility to send a workshop event. Therefore, it is more
;suitable to create a public entry point than UnassignObject(). Optionally, this function will run a resource reassignment after unassigning the specified
;object since UnassignObject() does usually not handle this on its own,

; specialized function to unassign actor from one object - called during AssignActor process on former owner of newly assigned object
;UFO4P 2.0.6 Bug #25439: Added the new bool argument bResetMode which will be passed by this function to the bUnassignActorMode bool on UnassignObject():
;ResetWorkshop() sets the multi-resource production values of all actors assigned to food or safety objects to zero when it starts running, and subsequently
;updates them while looping through the object arrays by adding the resource ratings of their owned objects back in, unless it finds that an object exedds an
;actor's production limit and then unassigns him. Thus, the resource ratings of objects unassigned by ResetWorkshop() are not yet included in an actor's multi-
;resource production value, but UnassignObject() silently assumes that they are and calculates new multi-resource production values by subtracting the resource
;ratings of the unassigned objects from their current multi-resource production values. This conflicts with the operations carried out by ResetWorkshop() as
;it leaves the actor with a wrong multi-resource production value and may even lead to objects exceeding his production limit being not properly unassigned.
;Therefore, we need to skip the multi-resource production value update on UnassignObject() for all calss from ResetWorkshop(). UnassignObject() already has a
;bool argument to handle this (bUnassignActorMode, if called by UnassignActor_Private, it skips those operations too), but ResetWorkshop(9 does not call that
;function directly but calls this function instead, and this function had no argument to pass that information.
;Note that this modification does not cause API issues because this function is a private function that must never be called directly by an external script.

	UFO4P 2.0.5 Bug #25129 Notes:
	
	In rare cases, this function may run if the workshop is not loaded. If we were still running the pure vanilla code, this case would be so rare that
	we wouldn't have to worry about it, but with the changes made by UFO4P to the workshop checks, this happens more often now (a workshop does count as
	not loaded if it is partially loaded, while the vanilla script would still count it as loaded then), and even more frequently if a mod is installed
	that makes settlers mortal. Though, even then, it's still a relatively rare case.
	If the workshop is not loaded, we run into problems:
	  (1) the script will not find the actor's work objects, or only some of them in the best case, and
	  (2) we cannot run a workshop resource recalculation. 
	Issue (1) implies that there will always be objects that cannot be handled here, so they have to be handled later, preferrably as soon as the workshop
	reloads. This is best left to the AssignObjectToWorkshop function which is called by ResetWorkshop on all objects and already did some of the operations
	anyway, but that code had to be improved because we also need to sent events on all of these objects (there's only one function that calls this function
	with bSendUnassignEvent = false and that function never runs if the workshop is not loaded).
	Issue (2) means that we actually can't send any events because many quests evaluate them by checking for changes in the workshop's resource rating values.
	On the other hand, not all quests are relying on Assign/Uunassign events specifically and some of these are unlikely to run if a workshop isn't loaded.
	Thus, what turned out to be unsafe to unassign after a detailed look at the individual quests and their event handling procedures are food and safety
	objects, also becuase they will continue to contribute to the workshop ratings until the workshop resources are recalculated (e.g. a crop will not count
	as unassigned and continue to contribute to a workshop's food production until its unassignment is reflected  in the ratings values, and this won't happen
	until the workshop resources have been successfully recalculated).
	Therefore, the following code has been modified to skip the handling of multi-resource objects if a workshop is not loaded. All other objects will still be
	handled in any situation. In the worst case, some quest will react to a resource change with some delay every one in a while, but this is still acceptable.
	It would be a problem only if it happened on a regualr basis.
	
	UFO4P 2.0.6 Bug #25238:
	We are now unassigning all objects we find, even if the workshop is not loaded. To solve the problem of object tracking (we still can't send events if a
	workshop is not loaded, as explained above, so ResetWorkshop must be able to identify them later on; we currently do this by their owning actors but this
	will no longer be possible if we unassign them here), we use an unused bool property on WorkshopObjectScript, "bResetDone", to tag them.

		UFO4P 2.0.4 Bug #24312:
		To optimize performance, this function has been completely rewritten. The modifications are summarized below.

		1. Loops through the actor arrays:
		----------------------------------
		The vanilla code was running three loops through the actor array:
		- Loop1 only handled wounded actors
		- Loop2 handled the remaining actors
		- Loop3 checked for new actors
		
		- Loop1 has been modified to run all operations that need to be done on all actors (such as calling AddActorToWorkshop). It also
		  still includes the special handling of wounded actors from loop1 of the vanilla script.
		- Loop2 has been modified to only handle the wounding of as yet unwounded actors. This only needs to run if there's a population
		  damage to apply, so a bool has been added to skip that loop if appropriate (which applies to > 95% of the cases where this
		  function runs!).
		- Loop3 has been removed and the check for new actors added to Loop1 instead.
		
		Thus, we're running only one loop most of the time now instead of three. This saves a fair bit of performance. In addition, loop1
		does not only unassign dead actors from the workshop now, but also removes them from the array. It can then pass the array to the
		SetUnassignedPopulationRating function which it calls at the end. This saves that function the time to create a new actor array.
		
		2. Loops through the resource object arrays:
		--------------------------------------------
		Some modifications were made to the damage passes that are called by these loops on all resource objects. If there's no damage
		left to apply after the first loop has run, the damage passes in the second loop can be skipped entirely. For that purpose,
		another bool has been added.
		
		3. Resource assignment procedures:
		----------------------------------
		The most substantial modifications were made to the resource assignment functions TryToAssignBeds and tryToAssignResourceType 
		which are called once by this function when it has finished looping through the resource object arrays. While the workshop is
		loaded, those functions are subsequently called in regular intervals from WorkhopScript (they run very often !).
		
		To get the assignment done, the vanilla functions did first loop through the actor array to identify the actors to assign to
		the respective resource type (i.e. beds, food objects or safety objects). Subsequently, they did create an array of those ob-
		jects and looped through it to identify those that were unassigned. If the function was called again, the whole procedure was
		repeated. Since most of the objects in the resource object arrays are already assigned or cannot be assigned at all (the safety
		objects array also contains all of the turrets) the vanilla functions spent most of their time with filtering out invalid ob-
		jects, and this time was wasted again every time one of the functions was called.
		
		To improve this, the actors to assign to the individual resource types and all unassigned objects are now stored in arrays,
		and the assignment functions do operate on these arrays now. Since they usually have only a tenth or less of the size of the
		full object arrays, they are much faster to process and assignment of beds, food and safety objects can be accomplished in
		less than a second, even on large workshops where the vanilla functions could easily run 10 seconds or longer to get the job
		done.

		The helper arrays created for this purpose are declared in a section that has been added at the end of this script. That
		section also includes a number of helper functions to handle them. These arrays are initialized by the OnLocationChange
		event before this function is called, and they are cleared again when the workshop unloads. This does not only avoid per-
		sistence but also keeps the volume of additional data that may be stored in a save game as low as possible. Though, even
		if the arrays are filled (i.e while the workshop is loaded), they rarely contain more than 1-2 items.

		To make this system work, the arrays need to be kept updated while the workshop is loaded: assigned actors and objects have to be
		removed (this is handled by the functions TryToAssignBeds and TryToAssignResourceType) and new objects (either built by the player
		or unassigned from other actors) and actors (either newly created or after having been assigned by the player) have to be added.
		This required additional minor modifications to the functions AddActorToWorkshop, AssignActorToObject, AssignObjectToWorkshop,
		UnassignActor_Private and UnassignObject. In this process, most of these functions have been rewritten too, and a number of minor
		bugs that were discovered while doing this have been fixed as well.

		Finally, a number of frequently used helper functions such as ActorOwnsBed() and IsObjectOwner() could be substantially simplified,
		so they are running now much faster too.

	UFO4P 2.0.6 Bug #25215: Modified this:
	The indixes of all resource rating values that are relevant for the damage calculations (i.e. 0 - food, 3 - safety, 4 - water, 5 - power)
	are now stored in a property on WorkshopObjectScript, so the damage passes performed by this function while looping through the object
	arrays do not need to check the objects for the corresponding actor values again and again. Though, this modification alone would only
	save us the calls of HasResourceValue() on WorkshopObjectScript; we would still have to check the value of the resource index to attribute
	it to the corresponding floats foodToDamage, foodToDamage, safetyToDamage and powerToDamage. To improve this, these floats are replaced by
	an array that holds the individual resource damage values at the positions specified by the resource index (i.e. at the same positions as
	the corresponding actor values in the WorkshopRatings array). This reduces the damage handling to a single line of code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Added by UFO4P 2.0.2 for Bug #23016:

	UFO4P_ResetCurrentWorkshop was added to reset the current workshop properties that are updated by the vanilla function SetCurrentWorkshop to their
	default values. The currentWorkshopID is supposed to be the ID of the workshop the player is currently staying at, and certain functions on this script
	and WorkshopScript that run operations relying on the workshop location being loaded are checking whether currentWorkshopID is the same as the ID of the
	workshop they run on before proceeding.

	However, the vanilla script did never reset currentWorkshopID if a location unloaded. It was updated to the new workshop location when the ResetWorkshop
	function started running, and in the meantime, it was holding the ID of the workshop last visited by the player. That workshop could have unloaded at any
	time and therefore, checking currentWorkshopID was not a safe way to determine whether a workshop was loaded.

	Unfortunately though, there is no easy way to tell whether the player left a workshop location because the OnLocationChange event records bogus leave
	events if the player enters menu mode or workshop mode (see the comments on bug #20576) that are indiscernible from valid leave events, so we had to
	conceive a workaround:

	 (1) All workbenches call this function from their OnUnload events, and if their workshopID is matching currentWorkshopID, the properties are reset.
	 (2) All operations relying on a workshop being loaded (this affects functions on this script and on WorkshopScript) are now checking whether the
		 respective workshop location is actually loaded, and if not, skip any unsafe operations and call this function instead to reset the properties.
	     For this purpose, they call UFO4P_IsWorkshopLoaded which performs the check and the subsequent reset, if needed.
	 (3) Checks were added to several functions that should not run on unloaded workshops, but did not have any checks in place to avoid this.

	;the Red Rocket Station workbench may load and unlaod while the player is at Sanctuary).

	;UFO4P 2.0.4 Bug #24503: moved this block of code here from the OnLocationChange event:
	;Clearing the attack bools as soon as the player leaves the area (if it is still flagged as under attack at this point) is faster than waiting
	;until the player has moved to another workshop. This makes sure that any activities of the workshop sctripts that were suspended because of

;UFO4P 2.0.4 Bug #24122: Replaced this function with the following version:
;(1) The 'IsLoaded' check is not reliable as it returns 'true' if only one cell of a location is still loaded.
;(2) We must check whether the passed-in workshop is the current workshop. If not, the check would always return false (a different
;    workshop cannot be loaded at the same time) and we might inadvertently reset the current workshop while it is still loaded.
;(3) added a bool argument to skip the call of UFO4P_ResetCurrentWorkshop() if appropriate.
bool function UFO4P_IsWorkshopLoaded (WorkshopScript workshopRef, bool bResetIfUnloaded = false)
	if workshopRef
		int workshopID = workshopRef.GetWorkshopID()
		if workshopID == currentWorkshopID
			if Game.GetPlayer().GetCurrentLocation() == workshopRef.myLocation || workshopRef.UFO4P_InWorkshopMode == true
				return true
			elseif bResetIfUnloaded
				UFO4P_ResetCurrentWorkshop (workshopID)
